# Git Configuration Fix

This file documents the resolution of nbstripout filter issues.

## Problem
- nbstripout filter was configured globally but pointed to non-existent Python path
- Caused errors when adding/committing Jupyter notebook files
- Blocked normal git operations

## Solution
- Disabled nbstripout filters locally in this repository
- Set local overrides to prevent global configuration interference
- Repository now functions normally without cleanup filters

## Status
✅ Git operations working normally  
✅ Notebooks can be committed without issues  
✅ No more filter-related errors
